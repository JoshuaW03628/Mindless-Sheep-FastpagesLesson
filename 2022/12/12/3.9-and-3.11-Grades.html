The link to the python algorithm that was supposed to correspond with the flowchart just led to a default Fastpages post with code for a simple number-squaring algorithm that seemed to have an error.

Your flowchart is also complete and shows demonstration of understanding, however it definitely could have been neater. Since you submitted late you were deducted 0.1.
