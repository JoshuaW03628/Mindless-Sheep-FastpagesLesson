<p>The lesson will start off with introducing what algorithms are and what they do, moreover, what their significance is.</p>

<p>3.9 Lesson 1 has the objective to teach the student of the outcome of similar algorithmic concepts and similar algorithms. In this lesson, you will see different ways on how algorithms are developed.</p>

<p>Lesson created by Akshat P.</p>

<p>What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed through CODE. There are set limitations, this is what makes algorithms fun, you can your imagination and create whatever you wan with your own instructions!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Algorithms can be written in different ways and still accomplish the same tasks</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Algorithms that appear similar can yield different side effects or results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some conditional statements can be written as the same as Boolean expressions (VICE VERSA)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Different algorithms can be developed or use dto solve the same problem.

  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="example-1---too-hot-too-cold-or-just-right">EXAMPLE #1 - Too Hot, too cold, or just right?</h1>

<p>What similarities do you notice about the two algorithms?</p>

<p>If the boolean expressions are the same, does that mean the results will be the same?</p>

<p><img src="/TripleAJ/images/lesson1.png" alt="FIRST PIC" /></p>

<p>So right here, the condition on the left is nested, the condition on the right is not nested.</p>

<p>You have to be careful, even if they look the same, they might not yield the same result.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-we-assign-54-to-our-algorithm">What happens if we assign 54 to our algorithm?</h2>
<p>When we alter and set limitations to our code, the algorithm would not work if we were to input a variable that does not satisfy the rules for the algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-we-assign-95-to-our-algorithm">What happens if we assign 95 to our algorithm?</h2>

<p>Since 95 is greater than 90, it is true, however else is also to be considered, and so this satisfied the conditionals (we learned this a week ago). Since 95 is also greater than or equal to 65, the algorithm satisfies.</p>

<p>Therefore both situations DO NOT yield the same results.</p>

<p>This is a simple overview on how algorithms work along with conditionals.</p>
