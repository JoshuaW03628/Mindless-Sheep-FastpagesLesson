# Notes
## Video 1

- Purpose of computing innovations: solve problems or pursue interests through creative expression
- Better understanding of the purpose = better program
- Examples:
    - Apps
        - Games
        - Social Media
        - Business
        - Productivity
    - Physical devices
        - Computers
        - Smart Phones/tablets
        - Smart devices
        - Wearables
    - Systems
        - E-commerce
        - Cloud Services
        - E-mail
- Guidelines for creating a purpose
    - Why does the innovation exist?
    - What problem(s) does it solve?
    - What does it allow us to do that we previously could not?
- Example:
    - Social media applications
        - Allows users to connect from a distance and archive activities
    - E-commerce
        - Allows users to save time and money by shopping online
    - Digital Assistant Device
        - Allows users to control the device hands-free, making it safer while driving or more convenient when multitasking

- Program input: data sent to a computer for processing by a program
    - May be tactile (touch), audio, visual, text (+ numerical values), etc...
- An event is associated with an action and supplies input data to a program
- Events can be generated in a variety of ways
    - pressing a key
    - clicking the mouse
    - tapping the screen
    - etc...
- Outputs usually depend on the input to a program
- Event-driven programming allows for program statements to be executed when triggered instead of through the sequential flow of control
- Input can come from a user or other programs
- Program outputs are any data sent from a program to a device
    - comes in a variety of forms
        - tactile
        - audio
        - visual
        - text
        - etc...
- Program output is usually based on a program's input or prior state
    - Example: internal values)
- Examples:
    - Smart phone inputs: tactile (tapping screen), audio (hey siri), visual (facial recognition), text (password)
    - Laptop: tactile (trackpad/mouse controls), text (password/keyboard actions)
    - Gaming console: tactile (controller buttons), visual (virtual reality)
- Most programs are written in an event driven environment
    - "Events" are triggered by some action, which usually sends input to the program
    - Examples of "events"
        - mouse clicks
        - screen taps/swipes
        - physical button clicks
        - keyboard entries
        - audio trigger (keyword or phrase such as "Hey Siri" or "Ok Google")
- Why is input important to a program?
    - Input usually affects the output
- Types of outputs
    - Visual, audio, tactile, text, etc...
    - Examples
        - Smart phone/tablet (visual, screen change), (audio), (tactile, vibrations), (text, notifications, etc...)
        - Laptop (visual), (audio), (text)
        - Gaming console (visual), (audio), (tactile), (text)
- How events work
    - an action triggers an event
    - action may be initiated by the user or another program/device
    - Program "jumps" to the code segment according to the event:
        - Code segment is executed
        - Output is triggered by the code segment (or additional events are triggered)
    - Event-driven programs are not always "in order"
        - Code segments are executed as they are called (according to the events triggered)

- A computer program is a collection of statements that are executed according to the rules of the programming language
- A program is a collection of program statements that performs a specific task when run by a computer. A program is often referred to as software
- A code segment is a collection of program statements that is part of a program
- A program needs to work for a variety of inputs and situations
- The behavior of a program is how a program functions during execution and is often described by how a user interacts with it
- A program can be described broadly by what it does, or in more detail by both what the program does and how the program statements accomplish this function
- What is a program?
    - A collection of statements
        - Statement: single command (tells computer what to do)
        - Group of statements: code segment
            - Code segments are executed according to the rules of the programming language
- Example:
    - Code segment:
        - Text:
        min <-- aList[1] <br>
        FOR EACH item IN aList <br>
        { <br>
            IF ( item < min) <br>
            { <br>
                min <-- item <br>
            } <br>
        } <br>
        DISPLAY ("The minimum number in the list is") <br>
        DISPLAY (min) <br>
        - Assigns aList[1] to variable min
        - Looks at each number in the list individually and repeats the code in the segment for each item in the list
            - If item is less than min (which is first number in the list)
                - Then, assign that item to be the new minimum
            - Repeat for all items in list
        - Displays message to the user about the lowest number that it found in the list
        - WHAT DOES THIS SEGMENT DO?
            - finds the minimum value in a list
        - Things to think about:
            - How can we make this work with a variety of different lists, such as:
                - numbers out of order
                - negative numbers
                - large numbers
                - decimals
        - This code segment can be inserted into a larger program
- Describing a code segment
    - State what it does (makes it easier for someone to use that segment in a larger program)
    - Good idea to include how it does what it does
        - Explain in detail how the code functions
        - Someone could expand upon it
