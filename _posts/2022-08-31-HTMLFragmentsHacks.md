# Hacks
1. Remote theme
    - Before remote theme:
    ![Before ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage before remote theme.jpg)
    ![Before ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage before remote theme 2.jpg)

    - After remote theme:
    ![after ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage hacker theme 1.jpg)
    ![after ss 1]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Fastpage hacker theme 2.jpg)

### Observations
- One thing I am 100% confident in is that I like how the default "miniima" theme looks
- The dark mode makes it very hard to read most of the text in the "Hacker" remote theme
- The remote theme looks a lot more vintage
- Remote theme does not support "pages" layout like the default (the little tabs in the top right become links instead)
- Hacker theme lacked organization and sectioning
- Looked like it was from the dinosaur era

3. I have made a category for hacks so that the user can navigate to the tags page and access all hacks that have been completed or are in progress.

4. Searching on my site seems to work properly for me.
